🚗 CarDekho SQL Data Analysis Project
📊 A Complete Data Exploration & Insights Project using MySQL

📌 Project Description
This project analyzes the CarDekho dataset using SQL to extract insights about car availability, fuel types, trends by year, and overall inventory patterns.
It includes a collection of SQL queries that solve real business questions such as car counts by year, fuel distribution, and historical data analysis.

📝 Project Overview
CarDekho is a popular automobile marketplace where customers buy and sell new and used cars.
To support business decisions, this project performs:
	•	Data exploration
	•	Trend analysis
	•	Inventory forecasting
	•	Fuel-type based segmentation
	•	Year-based comparisons
The SQL queries aim to replicate real-world business reporting and analytics requirements.

🔍 Problem Statement
CarDekho wants to understand inventory trends and fuel-based availability across different years.
The business team needs answers to questions like:
	•	How many cars will be available in a given year (2020–2023)?
	•	What is the distribution of cars by fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)?
	•	Which years had the highest count of cars?
	•	How many cars fall within a specific year range (2015–2023)?
This project solves such queries using clean and optimized SQL code.

🎯 Business Objectives
✔️ Provide accurate car counts for upcoming years
✔️ Analyze inventory trends year-over-year
✔️ Understand fuel-type preferences among users
✔️ Help management in forecasting demand
✔️ Build a structured SQL query repository for reporting
✔️ Extract complete dataset details for specific year ranges

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Import & Load Data
	•	Use SELECT * FROM cars.car_dekho;
	•	Explore schema
	•	Check columns, data types, null values

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
	•	Identify unusual year entries
	•	Check fuel-type consistency
	•	Remove or analyze missing values (if any)
  
3️⃣ Exploratory SQL Queries
	•	Total number of records
	•	Car counts for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023
	•	Fuel-wise distribution
	•	Grouping by year
	•	Filtering year ranges (e.g., 2015–2023)

4️⃣ Business Problem Solving
Your SQL solves real questions such as:
	•	Cars available in future years
	•	Diesel & petrol car counts
	•	Cars grouped by fuel type
	•	Cars between a specific range of years
	•	Identifying years with more than 100 cars

5️⃣ Final Insights Extraction
	•	Build summary tables
	•	Organize results for reporting
	•	Prepare insights for decision making

📈 Key SQL Queries Solved
You have included queries for:
	•	Year-wise inventory count
	•	Fuel-wise car count (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
	•	Group by year
	•	Cars between year range 2015–2023
	•	Finding years with more than 100 cars
	•	Comparing multiple years
These replicate real-world analytics tasks

📣 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze automobile marketplace data and solve practical business problems.
Using MySQL, you extracted meaningful insights about:
	•	Inventory distribution
	•	Year-based demand
	•	Fuel-type trends
	•	Complete historical records
This project is a great addition to your Data Analyst and SQL portfolio, showcasing your ability to write efficient queries and interpret business data.
